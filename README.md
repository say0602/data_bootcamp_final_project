# Project Description

The project is about making a prediction on the price of the house. There are 18 clinical features for predicting house price in the dataset. I will first explore and clean the data as I want for this prediction. Then I will build two models for prediction - KNN classifier and Random Forest. I am going to maximize each of their scores and then compare the two to distinguish which model we should use for the prediction.
